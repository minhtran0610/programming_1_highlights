The highlights of my work in the Programming 1 course at Tampere University

This repository includes the most oustanding parts of my work during the Programming 1 course at Tampere University. The majority of the files involve handling
basic Python data structures, the basics of object-oriented programming and using GUI with Tkinter in Python.

The final GUI of the course is in the folder project_GUI.
